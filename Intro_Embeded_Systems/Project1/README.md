# Stats
stats is a program that can analyze an array of unsigned char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and median of the data set. In addition, stats reorder this data set from large to small. All statistics should be rounded down to the nearest integer. After analysis and sorting is done, stats prints that data to the screen in nicely formatted presentation.
